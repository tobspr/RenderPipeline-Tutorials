# RenderPipeline Tutorials

These are tutorials for the <a href="http://github.com/tobspr/RenderPipeline">RenderPipeline</a> (RP)
that complement the documentation.

For all tutorials, a basic knowledge of Panda3D and Python is required. Futher knowledge
of graphics programming may help, but is certainly not required.

In order not to break the scope of a given tutorial, some details may be omitted.
For detailed information, please head over to the
<a href="http://github.com/tobspr/RenderPipeline/wiki" target="_blank">Render Pipeline Wiki</a>

The tutorials are ordered, and it usually makes sense to work through them sequentially.
