# RenderPipeline-Tutorials

These are tutorials for the render pipeline, to complement the documentation.

For all tutorials, a basic knowledge of Panda3D and Python is reqired. Futher knowledge
of graphics programming may help, but is certainly not required.

Notice that the tutorials might sometimes omit some details, to not break the scope of the tutorial.
For detailed information, please head over to the <a href="http://github.com/tobspr/RenderPipeline/wiki" target="_blank">Render Pipeline Wiki</a>

The tutorials are ordered, and it usually makes sense to work through them sequentially.
